Acknowledgments
The author of the project would like to express gratitude to Paulo Pinheuro, the original author of the Human Action Recognition code. 
His contribution has been invaluable, my work is built upon his original project available on Kaggle.

Regarding my contribution to the project, here is how I proceeded in developing the pipeline:

Evaluated which of the proposed CNN model performed better.
Conducted research over the Internet, and asked to ChatGPT how to improve the model performance.
Performed comparison of different model configurations.
Introduced the possibility to save/load the trained model.
Wrote the documentation.
