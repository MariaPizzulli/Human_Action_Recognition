Acknowledgments
The authors of the project would like to express gratitude to Paulo Pinheuro, the original author of the Human Action Recognition code. 
His contribution has been invaluable, and our work builds upon his original project available on Kaggle.

Regarding my contribution to the project, here is how I proceeded in developing the pipeline:

Evaluated which of the proposed CNN model performs better.
Conducted research over the Internet about other alternatives.
Performed model comparison.
Wrote the documentation.
